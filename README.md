# truffle
Solidity course project in truffle framework

## configuration
There are some requirements for the project to work.<br>
We need to add 3 files which contain some private data.
These files need to be in the root project folder.
- .etherscan -> etherscan api key
- .infura -> infura api key
- .secret -> seed phrase (e.g. from metamask)
